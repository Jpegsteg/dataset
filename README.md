# JPEG Steganalysis Dataset

This dataset contains various steganography datasets for steganalysis. The datasets included are J-UNIWARD, UERD, nsF5, and ED-JC.Each dataset is organized into three different JPEG quality factors: 75, 85, and 95. Within each quality factor folder, there are further subfolders containing cover and stego image folders. The link to the dataset folder is given below:

Note: The stego folders (e.g., stego751) indicate that steganography is performed at a specific quality factor (e.g., 75) with an embedding rate of 0.1 bits per non-zero AC coefficient (bpnzAC).
